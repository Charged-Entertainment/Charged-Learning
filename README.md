# Charged Learning
An educational puzzle game, whose player can both enjoy an entertaining
experience regardless of their scientific interest level, all the while implicitly gaining
valuable experience and knowledge in electric circuits design, where they can opt-in
for a more academic learning experience through references to external materials,
data-sheets, and circuit schematics designed to encourage real-life experimentation,
and allow for academic instructors and supervisors to supplement their coursework
and practical assignments with select (or all) sections of the game. Submitted as a graduation project for a BSc. Computer Science @ MUST University 2022/2023.
